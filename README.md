After cloning the project,

- You open the folder named "assignment_twendee" with Visual Studio Code, press "ctrl+` at the same time", a dialog box will appear and you will see "Terminal".
- Or if you don't have VS Code, you can click on the path on the folder's path bar, remove all characters and type "cmd", you will get the "Terminal" dialog.
- At "Terminal" you will see your current directory, if not "assignment_twendee" name you need to move to it.
- For example, you have the path: "E:\new folder\folder1\assignment_twendee". But at "Terminal" shows :"E:\new folder>" you move to "assignment_twendee" by typing command "cd folder1" and press Enter. Then you will reach :"E:\new folder\folder1>" and you need to continue executing the command "cd assignment_twendee". Because each "cd" we can only get to the nearest subdirectory level. You can't "cd assignment_twendee" in the first place.
- After reaching "E:\new folder\folder1\assignment_twendee>",
  - You type the command "npm install" to install the necessary libraries for the app
  - Next type "npm start", you will need to wait a few minutes for the app to start in your browser.
